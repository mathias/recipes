My recipes. Almost always *vegan* and usually tasty. I'll put in some notes about different ways I've tried to make them, and how that turned out. 

I make a lot of soups in the winter, and I like to make various types of bakery. YMMV. Create your own recipe book or at least modify my README if you're going to fork and fill it with non-vegan recipes ;)
