# Baked Oatmeal

## Setup

Preheat oven to 376 degrees.

In a large mixing bowl, mash two bananas well.

On top of this, add the dry ingredients:
* 2 cups rolled or thick cut oats
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 tsp salt (optional)

In your 1-cup measuring cup (or a coffee mug), combine 1 tsp egg replacer powder with roughly 1/2 cup warm/hot water. Whisk well. This is your "egg".

Quickly add all the liquid ingredients to the mix:

* your fake egg
* 1.5 cups almond milk
* 1 tsp vanilla

Stir well.

Line an 8" pan (I use a glass casserole dish) with parchment paper for easy removal and cutting.

Pour batter into the pan.

Bake for 25 minutes. Then add maple syrup to the top and return to the oven for another 5 minutes.

Makes about 6 portions.

### Variations:

#### Apple Cinnamon:

Chop one half of an apple and add half of it to the batter before you put it in the pan. Add 1/2 tsp cinnamon to batter and stir well.

After pouring the batter into the pan, top with the rest of the chopped apple and sprinkle on some cinnamon. Bake as above, but can skip the maple syrup.

## Note:

Only stays good on a counter for about 1-2 days. Probably longer refrigerated.
