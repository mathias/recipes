Pumpkin Oatmeal Cookies
=======================

Yield: About 2 dozen

Equipment:
==========

* baking sheets
* 1 mixing bowl

Ingredients:
============

* 1 cups flour
* 2/3 cups rolled oats
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
* 2/3 cups sugar
* 1/3 cup canola oil (I used 1/3 cup apple sauce instead)
* 1 tablespoons molasses
* 1 cup canned pumpkin, or cooked pureed pumpkin
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
* 1/2 cup walnuts, finely chopped
* 1/4 cup raisins

Setup:
======
Preheat oven to 350. Have ready 2 greased baking sheets.

1. Mix together flour, oats, baking soda, salt and spices.
2. In a separate bowl, mix together sugar, oil, molasses, pumpkin and vanilla until very well combined.
3. Add dry ingredients to wet in 3 batches, folding to combine.
4. Fold in walnuts and raisins.
5. Drop by tablespoons onto greased cookie sheets.
   They don't spread very much so they can be placed only an inch apart.
   Flatten the tops of the cookies with a fork or with your fingers, to press into cookie shape.
6. Bake for 16 minutes at 350. If you are using two sheets of cookies on 2 levels of your oven, rotate the sheets halfway through for even baking.
7. Remove from oven and move cookies onto a wire rack to cool.
