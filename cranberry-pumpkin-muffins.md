Cranberry Pumpkin Muffins
=========================

Ingredients:
============
* 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flor
* 1 1/4 cups sugar
* 1 tbsp baking powder
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
* 1/2 tsp ground ginger
* 1/4 tsp ground allspice
* 1/8 tsp ground cloves
* 1 cup pureed pumpkin (make sure you donâ€™t use pumpkin pie mix!)
* 1/2 cup soymilk (or almond milk)
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil
* 2 tbsp molasses
* 1 1/4 cup dried cranberries

Setup:
======
Preheat oven to 400. 
Either grease a 12-muffin tin or use muffin papers.

1. Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and spices.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together pumpkin, soy milk, oil, and molasses.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix.
4. Fold in cranberries.
5. Fill the muffin cups 2/3 full. 
6. Bake for 20-25mins, until a toothpick or knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
7. Let stand 10 minutes then serve hot.

Notes:
======

The next time I make this I will probably use 1 1/2 tbsp of molasses as it was a little strong with the full 2 tbsp.
These aren't quite the same as Alterra's Cranberry Pumpkin muffins, which is what I was trying to duplicate.
But, we found out they're delicious frozen and unheated, which is weird but neat.
